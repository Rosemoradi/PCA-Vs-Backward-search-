#  Dimensionality Reduction: PCA vs Backward Feature Elimination

This project compares two powerful dimensionality reduction techniques‚Äî**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **Backward Feature Elimination (BFE)**‚Äîto evaluate their effect on classification performance using **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** on synthetic 10D data.

---

##  Project Overview

We simulate two classes of data with overlapping Gaussian distributions across 10 correlated features and apply:

-  **PCA**: Projects data onto principal components that preserve maximum variance
- ‚úÇ **Backward Search**: Greedily removes the least useful features for classification

Each method is evaluated on how classification error changes as dimensionality is reduced.

##  Key Components

###  Dataset
- 2 synthetic classes (1000 samples each)
- 10 continuous features with block-structured covariance
- Ground truth labels: 0 (Class 1), 1 (Class 2)

###  Algorithms Used

| Method | Approach | Evaluation |
|--------|----------|------------|
| PCA | Unsupervised, variance-preserving | Reconstruction MSE & LDA accuracy |
| Backward Search | Supervised, greedy feature removal | Classification error minimization |

---

##  Results

###  PCA
- Retains variance but shows fluctuations in classification error
- Accuracy improves with dimensionality, but not always optimal

###  Backward Search
- More stable and effective in reducing classification error, especially in low dimensions
- Removes features with least contribution to LDA

 **Conclusion**:  
Backward Search yields better accuracy when fewer dimensions are retained, while PCA is faster and still useful when preserving structure.
